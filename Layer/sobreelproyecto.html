      <h1>UNAS PALABRAS SOBRE EL PROYECTO</h1>
      
        <p>Para√≠so Aborigen (Canarian Heritage) aims to encompass an authentic, critical and limitless view of the sites and ways of life of the ancient Canaries.</p>
        <p>We intend to address both its structure and history in order to learn much more, through theories and verified information, a little more about our culture.</p>
        <p>This project seeks nothing more than to expand knowledge and respect for our ancient culture, any contribution is welcome.</p>
        <p>We have no way of financing except our own resources, the desire to explore, discover and share with everyone.</p>

      <h1>RESOURCES</h1>
    
        <p>We only have smartphones, editing and development equipment, some time and a great desire to show the world the beauty of an increasingly interesting and continuously discovered world.</p>

        <h1>PURPOSE</h1>
    
        <p>This platform is constantly changing and developing, the intention is to reach as many people as possible, so that the experience reaches everyone
          regardless of their abilities, contributing new ideas and acquiring new materials to make it possible.</p>

        <p>The platform has TikTok, Instagram, YouTube and Facebook, all of them with a different purpose and adapted to all ages, converging in a central point
          where all the content is located.</p>

        <p>As mentioned, the project has a playful objective, we do not gain anything except the satisfaction of learning and that the pre-Hispanic heritage of the Canary Islands is
          accessible to all.</p>
